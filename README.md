### devArchive
DevArchive is a Chrome extension that saves users from repeatedly hunting down the same solutions online. When a useful solution is found, the user can save it with one click. Later if you search for the same problem, DevArchive will bring up the previously saved solution and provide you with the text youâ€™ve highlighted. We believe our product will benefit frequent search engine users like coders and researchers by preventing the loss of useful websites and saving the time spent finding them.

## Usage
Go to (chrome://extensions/)
Turn on developer mode
Click load unpacked
Select the devarchive folder
Pin the extension and start using it!
